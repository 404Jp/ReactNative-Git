Description:
This mobile application, developed using React Native and Expo, aims to facilitate food donation and combat hunger as its primary objective. The app allows users to share information about locations where food is given away for free. Data is stored in real-time on Firebase to ensure the accuracy of information and to facilitate real-time collaboration among users.

Objective:
The core objective of this application is to contribute to achieving one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: "Zero Hunger" (SDG 2). We aim to simplify the way people can help those in need of food, promoting solidarity and efficient resource distribution.

Technologies Used:

React Native: The application is developed using React Native, enabling a smooth and native-like experience on iOS and Android devices.
Expo: We have used the Expo platform to simplify the development and deployment of the application.
Firebase Realtime Database: Firebase is used to store and synchronize data in real-time, ensuring that information about food locations is always up-to-date.
